				<span>Chicken</span>
				<br>
				A chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a kind of domesticated bird. It is raised in many places for its meat and eggs. They are usually kept by humans as livestock. Most breeds of chickens can fly for a short distance. Some sleep in trees (if there are trees around). A male chicken is called a rooster or a cock(erel). A female chicken is called a hen; a young chicken is called a chick. Like other female birds, hens lay eggs. The eggs hatch into chicks. When raising chickens, a farmer needs a chicken coop (like a little house) for the chickens to roost (sleep) in. They also need a run or yard where they can exercise, take dust baths, eat and drink. The chickens also need to be protected from predators such as foxes. Fences are often used for this. Chickens can also be farmed intensively. This lets farms make a lot of chicken meat and eggs.

				<span>Beef</span>
				<br>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of protein and nutrients. Most beef can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak, while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, which are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands, the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull. Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from calves is called veal. Beef from steers and heifers is similar. Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince. Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot, where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.

				<span>Sushi</span>
				<br>Sushi is made with specially prepared rice, called sumeshi. The rice is mixed with vinegar, salt, and sugar. Sushi is known for having raw or cooked seafood in it. Some sushi is wrapped in a sheet of seaweed called nori. Sushi is traditionally eaten by hand, but it is not wrong to eat it using chopsticks. Gari must be eaten with chopsticks. There are many different kinds of sushi. Sometimes you may find other ingredients on top of the sumeshi, such as roe, and sea urchin meat, instead of fish. Another type of sushi, makizushi, consists of sumeshi rolled around fish and/or vegetables. In the US, makizushi is more popular than nigirizushi. Another type is known as temaki or a hand roll. This kind of sushi comes in a cone-shape, created by the nori wrapped around the ingredients inside. They are usually filled with a mixture of sumeshi, fish, and vegetables. Sushi is eaten with your bare hands or chopsticks. Soy sauce and wasabi are commonly eaten with sushi. Gari can often be found alongside a plate of sushi and also a little bit of wasabi, used as a palate cleanser. In Japan, sushi is sometimes sold in "conveyor-belt shops" called kaiten zushi, where plates of sushi are put on a moving belt that passes by the customers. People freely take the sushi they want as it passes. The price of sushi is shown by the plates color. This way of serving sushi is becoming popular in other countries as well.
